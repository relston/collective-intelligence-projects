The book mentioned that: 
. Item-based filtering is faster but has more overhead (extra steps)
.. what is that step?
.. creating a similarity table
. Sparse and dense data sets
.. if every reviewer has rated every movie, then the data is dense - More accurate
... if not, like users bookmarking links (user have fewer shared Items) it's sparse = less accurate
... item base filtering will outperform user base filtering with sparse Data sets
. user-based filtering is simpler
.. similar users might have added value depending on an Application

What would be a diagram for the chapter 2 examples? item-based Filtering and people based filtering?
